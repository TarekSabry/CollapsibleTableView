### CollapsibleTableView

Collapsible Tableview  was one of my biggest problems when I first started learning iOS let alone a tableview cell that auto resizes with the content inside it, I imagined that I'd never be able to do such thing no matter what happens, but today I finally came over that problem and I implemented a fully working collapsible tableview and auto resizing content.

The repo is written in Swift using MVC, feel free to fork it and convert to objective c if you want to.

The whole purpose of this repo was for me to learn how these stuff work and help beginners who are unable to achieve such a thing.
